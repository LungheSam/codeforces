# Codeforces Problem Solutions

Welcome to my Codeforces problem-solving repository! This repo contains solutions to various problems I have solved on Codeforces, organized by difficulty and topic. Each solution is accompanied by a brief explanation of the approach used.

## Repository Structure

- **Problems**: Each folder represents a problem and contains:
  - Problem description
  - Solution code (in the language used)
  - Approach and explanation

Feel free to explore, and if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute!

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the folders to find problems.
2. Review the problem statement and solution code.


Happy Coding
